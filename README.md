# Hospital Waste Object Detection using YOLOv8

This project focuses on detecting different categories of hospital waste using a deep learning object detection model (YOLOv8). The goal is to support safer and more efficient medical waste management through automated visual classification.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset obtained from Roboflow and implemented in Python using Ultralytics YOLOv8.
